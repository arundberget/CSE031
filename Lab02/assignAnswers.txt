Assignment 1:
1. It doesn't look like it's telling me a line in the file. It kept refering to vfscanf-internal.c and isoc99_scanf.c.
2. I made sum into a pointer in read_values.
3. there should be a & on the input variable.
4. You replace input with &input in the scanf function.

Assignment 2:
1. It didn't add spaces and there is the phrase llo! at the end which shouldn't be there.
2. It added hellhi! to the end. 
3. I think it breaks because it can only handle 10 characters unless you expand it to like 100.
