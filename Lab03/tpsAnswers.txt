TPS 1:
1. The 3 pools for memory are stack, heap, and static. Stack holds local variables. Heap holds dynamic memory allocation functions like malloc and calloc. Static holds global variables, static variables, and constants.
2. In file.
a) There are three variables declared.
b) Two of them are pointers. ptr points to num. handle points to the pointer ptr.
c) These are stored in the heap because they use dynamic memory allocation.
d) This would point to the heap.
3. Drawing is external.
4. My drawing is external.

TPS 2:
1. This program defines a struct node which is a node in a linked list. Each of the nodes has the variables decleared at the beginning. head is the first node in the linked list.
2. Code is in the file.
3. The head holds the value of the first node.
